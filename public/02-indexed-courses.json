First, we will consider the different artistic media and their means of production, with special focus on ceramics, metalsmithing, seals, sculpture, and architecture. Second, we will approach the art of the Ancient Near East as cultural documentation, exploring concepts of empire, power, religion, funerary practice, and the establishment of stratified societies.

This course examines the political, religious, economic, and social institutions of seventeenth-century Rome as manifested in the careers of its three most revoluntionary artists: Caravaggio, Bernini, and Borromini. All three were radical designers who changed the history of the media in which they worked. Carravaggio's avant-garde naturalism transformed European painting; Bernini's sculpture brought a new visual language to that medium; and Borromini expanded the formal and ideological possibilities of architecture. One died in misery in the prime of life; one dominated art production in Rome for over half a century; and one committed suicide in despair-- but each negotiated the challenging patronage structure of the papal city. Baroque Rome is seen through the biographies of these major figures in the history of Western Art.","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=Oh9NWcxj23sC4KR8ishbIAfk8MuPUd4U&q.courseSubject=ARTH&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=3385","name":"Baroque Rome","department":"ARTH","course_num":3385,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:3390":{"courseID":"ARTH:3390","description":"","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=KMfqUZOWuMoC4KR8ishbIAfk8MuPUd4U&q.courseSubject=ARTH&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=3390","name":"Early Medieval Art","department":"ARTH","course_num":3390,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:3391":{"courseID":"ARTH:3391","description":"Themes and topics in medieval art.","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=WZkzkGJOfNQC4KR8ishbIN_gZe_iIJf0&q.courseSubject=ARTH&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=3391","name":"Themes in Medieval Art","department":"ARTH","course_num":3391,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:3400":{"courseID":"ARTH:3400","description":"","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=B8zBOj5rX34C4KR8ishbIN_gZe_iIJf0&q.courseSubject=ARTH&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=3400","name":"Romanesque and Gothic Architecture","department":"ARTH","course_num":3400,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:3410":{"courseID":"ARTH:3410","description":"","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=H1P1NaRhaMoC4KR8ishbIN_gZe_iIJf0&q.courseSubject=ARTH&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=3410","name":"Who Killed Gothic Architecture?","department":"ARTH","course_num":3410,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:3420":{"courseID":"ARTH:3420","description":"Gothic architecture and its history, from varied perspectives (e.g., formal structural, symbolic, geometric, socioeconomic).","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=Me7VG7vZkmQC4KR8ishbIN_gZe_iIJf0&q.courseSubject=ARTH&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=3420","name":"Gothic Architecture","department":"ARTH","course_num":3420,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:3520":{"courseID":"ARTH:3520","description":"Visual and cultural origins of Michelangelo's sculpture, painting, and architectural designs;

In this course we will study exciting and innovative artists working in France from approximately 1860-1915 who forged new directions in art and were major figures in Impressionism, Post-Impressionism and Symbolism as well as early 20th-century art. The depiction of modern life, the dream of the exotic, trends in subjectivity and other avant-garde developments in painting, posters, prints and sculpture will be addressed. Artists' manifestoes, new theories of art and the aggressive founding of movements will be critically examined. Works of art will be considered in the aesthetic, cultural, and political contexts in which they were made.

Plants play an indispensable role in the world's ecology and civilizations. This course provides an overview of the observation and scientific research which have contributed to our current understanding of plant biology ranging all the way from the molecular level to the Earth's biosphere. Beginning with the basic structural and functional aspects of plant cells, tissues, and organs, the class integrates fundamental aspects of plant biochemistry such as photosynthesis, respiration, mineral nutrition, and growth requirements. Basic genetics is presented from a botanical perspective including the reproductive biology of flowering plants and the pioneering work of Mendel through present-day understanding of DNA structure and function, mutation, evolution, and plant biotechnology. The course also provides a brief survey of plant diversity and evolution spanning some 3 1\/2 billion years of history from the origin of life and the oldest algal forms through the evolution of flowering plants. There are two and one half hours of lecture and two hours of lab per week. We will also utilize the rooftop greenhouse in adjacent BBE for several of our meetings.Grades are based on selected assignments, two exams (with lecture and lab portions), and the comprehensive final exam. Purchase of the textbook (Biology of Plants, 7th edition, by Raven et al, 2005) is highly recommended; copies of this and related useful references will also be available at the Biology Library reference desk.","hours":4,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=OOMYHWEkkSlZ-DiaEw8kEmGT2BO6F0Rn&q.courseSubject=BIOL&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=1261","name":"Introduction to Botany","department":"BIOL","course_num":1261,"before":[],"after":[]},"BIOL:1360":{"courseID":"BIOL:1360","description":"Recognition and identification of spring-flowering herbaceous plants, native woodland trees and shrubs, woody landscape plants; family characteristics, use of taxonomic key.","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=xmw6X5clMiRZ-DiaEw8kEmGT2BO6F0Rn&q.courseSubject=BIOL&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=1360","name":"Spring Flora","department":"BIOL","course_num":1360,"before":[],"after":[]},"BIOL:1370":{"courseID":"BIOL:1370","description":"Evolution and diversity of living things, their patterns on Earth, their organization in ecological systems; dynamics of evolutionary processes.

methodology of scientific research applied to developmental genetics. This course is designed for senior undergraduates majoring in the life sciences and graduate students. How multicellular animals develop has long been a central area of study in the biological sciences. Technological innovations in recent years have stimulated a virtual explosion of new information and conceptual breakthroughs, providing molecular mechanisms for fundamental developmental processes. The object of this course is to provide an intellectual foundation for understanding the current research literature in developmental biology through in-depth analysis of selected systems. As noted in the course title, a major emphasis is to explore the genetic regulation of developmental pathways and processes. However, organismal, cellular, and biochemical perspectives are discussed when appropriate. The course provides an in-depth examination of topics in pattern formation, cell fate specification, and differentiation. Readings are primarily from research articles and reviews, providing a particularly detailed study of selected processes, in development, drawing on examples primarily from Drosophila and vertebrate systems. Emphasis is on understanding development through molecular genetic technologies. Attendance is required. Grades are based on three take-home exams.","hours":3,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=sKgoaGZ2s-mWjZ0lybPrNHyUg6hXHxD1&q.courseSubject=BIOL&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=4333","name":"Genes and Development","department":"BIOL","course_num":4333,"before":[],"after":[]},"BIOL:4353":{"courseID":"BIOL:4353","description":"Physiological properties of nerve cells, nervous systems; axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, sensory transduction, integrative processes, higher functions.","hours":4,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=-B6Vo7-Cx3JBgbb95rjSF18oCV9VlCYP&q.courseSubject=BIOL&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=4353","name":"Neurophysiology: Cells and Systems","department":"BIOL","course_num":4353,"before":[],"after":[]},"NSCI:4353":{"courseID":"NSCI:4353","description":"Physiological properties of nerve cells, nervous systems; axonal conduction, synaptic transmission, sensory transduction, integrative processes, higher functions.","hours":4,"href":"http:\/\/catalog.registrar.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/dashboard.page?showResults=&_ticket=sthujOi0NlZBgbb95rjSF18oCV9VlCYP&q.courseSubject=NSCI&q.sessionId=67&q.courseNumber=4353","name":"Neurophysiology: Cells and Systems","department":"NSCI","course_num":4353,"before":[],"after":[]},"BIOL:4373":{"courseID":"BIOL:4373","description":"Theory underlying phylogenetic analysis with application of these methods to molecular data sets; analysis of multigene data, organellar, and nuclear genome sequences to reconstruct the history of cells.

No previous knowledge of anthropology or linguistics is presumed. The course has a strong historical component which situates several theoretical traditions. Following an introductory consideration of language as a formal system from a semiotic point of view that emphasizes the relationship between form and function, readings turn to issues in linguistic anthropology and ways in which anthropology has construed the relationship between language and culture. Consideration is given to issues of classical and contemporary research, including ethnoscience or lexical semantics, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, speech act theory and philosophy of speech, ethnography of speaking, performance and oral poetics, critical discourse analysis, language ideology and metalanguage, and linguistic hegemony and language politics.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=dkCWoZPTvhuvohkhkp8nTOXViknJMnWG&id=841130&ci=149430","name":"Seminar: Linguistic Anthropology","department":"ANTH","course_num":5401,"before":[],"after":[]},"ANTH:6005":{"courseID":"ANTH:6005","description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","hours":1.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=9LKcuhqCLkuvohkhkp8nTC58yI4ejB20&id=832073&ci=149517","name":"Independent Study: Anthropology","department":"ANTH","course_num":6005,"before":[],"after":[]},"ANTH:6010":{"courseID":"ANTH:6010","description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","hours":1.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=DWi9xGbi7vavohkhkp8nTDCtfNMxRz94&id=832074&ci=149518","name":"Research Anthropology","department":"ANTH","course_num":6010,"before":[],"after":[]},"ANTH:6015":{"courseID":"ANTH:6015","description":"If you have not received permission from the instructor to add this section, your enrollment may be administratively dropped.","hours":1.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=M97XCOl6eGnVvPA4CU--2WlIsIVeWhWC&id=832075&ci=149519","name":"Thesis","department":"ANTH","course_num":6015,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTE:6267":{"courseID":"ARTE:6267","description":null,"hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=zkZ-QzZW7QTZr6CGswNEnBTTpbfGzDeP&id=852047&ci=155350","name":"Seminar Current Issues in Art Education","department":"ARTE","course_num":6267,"before":[],"after":[]},"ARTH:6020":{"courseID":"ARTH:6020","description":"This course explores issues critical to the academic and professional development of art history graduate students.

Emerging gaming technologies both draw on cinematic traditions and amplify our embodied experience of scale, heightening both our ability to shrink down and to loom large over the sets and figures that visual narratives comprise. In the near future, emerging VR technology will significantly shift the existing relations of scale among entertainment media and everyday space within the home.\nThis graduate seminar engages with theories of scale in both cinema and wider visual culture. We will read scholarship from a range of disciplines (including literary criticism, film theory, psychopathology, critical videogame studies, and socio-anthropology) and therefore approach questions about scale from multiple vantage points. The syllabus\u2019s core concepts are built around works by Susan Stewart, Mary Ann Doane, Gaston Bachelard, Roland Barthes, and Walter Benjamin.

Our aim will always be to engage the imagination. There will be a series of shorter written assignments, an oral presentation, and a final written project. Some of the readings will be drawn from the likes of Homer, Sappho (the only ancient Greek female poet we know by name), Plato, the anonymous authors of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, the (also anonymous) early Spanish-language texts known as jarchas, the Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus, the Medieval troubadour poets of southern France, Baroque Spanish and Italian verse, and the writings of the great seventeenth-century Mexican nun Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz.

This course will look at the human experience of love, loss, and longing across a wide variety of traditions and time periods. The idea will be to glance into a number of literatures without having to identify a single thread or story among them other than our own responses and reflections. This will be an exercise in reading for better living, in learning a bit about how others have thought about love and loss in order to expand our own ways of seeing the world. There won\u2019t be any books to purchase. The readings will be available online. We will work on paying close attention to short texts through simple readings. Our aim will always be to engage the imagination. There will be a series of shorter written assignments, an oral presentation, and a final written project. Some of the readings will be drawn from the likes of Homer, Sappho (the only ancient Greek female poet we know by name), Plato, the anonymous authors of the Thousand and One Arabian Nights, the (also anonymous) early Spanish-language texts known as jarchas, the Roman poets Virgil, Ovid, and Catullus, the Medieval troubadour poets of southern France, Baroque Spanish and Italian verse, and the writings of the great seventeenth-century Mexican nun Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz. We\u2019ll think a bit about different kinds of love, what it means to feel so strongly the presence of something that no longer exists or that is far away, about the nature of life, death, joy, sorrow, that sort of thing.

But, did you know that the idea of a single united Church has never been a historical reality? From the earliest generations, Christians debated and fought over such issues as the exact nature of Jesus, whether or not they had to be Jewish, and even whether it was the teaching or the death of Jesus that brought salvation. In an age of sectarian dispute, how could you know which group had the \u201ctrue\u201d message and path to salvation? Since Jesus wrote nothing himself, authority was sought through his apostles and closest associates. And, since they did not have armies, their battles over authority were waged through narratives. This course will examine these battles over authority by analyzing several of the early Christian gospels, both canonical (e.g. Matthew and John) and non-canonical (e.g. Thomas, Mary, and Judas), paying particular attention to the depiction of Jesus and his apostles.

Students read and discuss accounts by professional writers, student writers, teachers of writing, and writing researchers. The discipline of composition studies, as well as reflections by writers on writing, is rich with interesting documentation, important theory, and vigorous dialogue. Students write for an audience to read and respond, in a broad variety of genres including the personal essay, the poem, short fiction, short nonfiction, the letter, the one-pager, and an experimental blur of genres. Writing is one tool for working out thinking. It is a link between inner speech and a frame for talk, a link between writer\/speakers and reader\/listeners. It is a writing teacher's responsibility to create an environment that ensures a diet of varied writing and broad reading, a community of rich, specific responders, and lots of opportunities for revising and careful editing. Along with the development of the individual writer-reader, the \"social construction of knowledge\" is an important concept in a writing class, and students experience it in this course. There are no actual stages, there is no specific process, but we can describe and theorize about prewriting techniques, revision strategies, conferencing models, inventories of grammatical conventions and mechanics, and publishing opportunities. Describing writing allows us to freeze the action to discover conditions under which writing takes place, and what the differences are in every writer's approach. To teach writing, you need to see that the act of writing is different with each piece you write, that you contribute to the next piece you write with each piece you read.\nEnglish majors may apply this course to the following area and\/or period requirement.

This has been especially true in the world of literary nonfiction where voice is shorthand for aesthetic or rhetorical artistry. Yet written texts don\u2019t really have voices. They may be teeming with stylistic codes, but those are quiet things. In the silence of the printed word, voice is at best a trope for the formal construction of a work across different stylistic registers. Not so in the case of radio where voice means vocalization, where words sound off. When an essay learns how to speak, when it has a real \u201cvoice,\u201d what can it say? In this workshop, we\u2019ll explore voice quite literally as an acoustic event by experimenting with three modes of radiophonic nonfiction\u2014narrative, essayistic, and documentary (students will complete projects in two out of three of these genres). Along with a good deal of revising, we will do close readings and critiques of student work, in both written and radiophonic form, as well as read and listen to selected radio essayists and sound artists. Each student\u2019s written and studio work will receive at least two formal workshops over the course of the semester.\u00a0The goal of this class is to help you discover, develop, and strengthen your capacities as a writer of artful nonfiction that is as compelling to the ear as to the eye. You\u2019ll use the English Department\u2019s media studio for sound work, learning how to produce voiceovers, record interviews, capture sounds and music, and edit these things with spoken texts.","hours":4.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=3WKTDfqT6jGPvYL2knyz3PS14lRMWZ5v&id=836593&ci=160044","name":"Nonfiction Writing Workshop                                            Radio Essays","department":"CNW","course_num":6620,"before":[],"after":[]},"CNW:6630":{"courseID":"CNW:6630","description":"In this graduate thesis workshop, which is a requirement for all 3rd year students in the NWP, we will consider the special concerns of writers who are engaged in extended and serious works-in-progress, and how we can serve as effective and rigorous editors for others' evolving projects.

We\u2019ll read \u201cSonny\u2019s Blues\u201d by James Baldwin and pair him with Kendrick Lamar, marveling at how Baldwin is able to capture, in words, the ecstatic feeling of a perfect improvisation.\nCoursework will include reading, listening, and writing. We will spend class time responding to readings and listening with creative free writing. Your final portfolio will be comprised of works of fiction or nonfiction composed over the course of the semester. More than anything, this class will be about translating that spark of joy that we all experience in music into the world of writing.\nBelow please find texts likely to be required (available at Prairie Lights Books):\nA Visit from the Goon Squad, Jennifer Egan","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=mlL1ZlXbultwHE0JGuYbUB01o3BB_hSW&id=834714&ci=158404","name":"Creative Writing for the Musician","department":"CW","course_num":4751,"before":[],"after":[]},"CW:4760":{"courseID":"CW:4760","description":"This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

However, more broadly, our aim is to introduce the fundamental theoretical underpinnings of modern \u201cdata science\u201d and \u201cmachine learning\u201d methods.\n\u00a0\nThe class is targeted at upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. Students enrolling in this class must be familiar with basic signals and systems and probability concepts. Specifically, a working knowledge of Fourier series and transforms, linear filtering, random variables and probability densities and distributions is essential. However, knowledge of more advanced concepts such as sampling theory, random processes and characteristic functions will not be assumed.\n\u00a0\nThis class will be unapologetically abstract and mathematical; it is not \u201chands-on\u201d in any way, there are no labs and while there will be references to practical applications, that is explicitly not the focus of this class.

No new taxes.\" - George Bush, 1988. Americans have always held strong opinions about taxes. And well they should. Federal, state, and local taxes now average about 30 percent of Gross National Product. Our objective in this course is to answer several questions about the U. S. tax system: Is it fair? Does it discourage saving? Working? Does it put U.S. businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the new \"global\" economy? How can it be improved? Are taxes too high? Answers depend on tax policies in other countries since, in today's highly integrated global economy, the effects of a nation's tax system do not stop at its borders. We first study the basic concepts and theory needed to analyze the effects of taxes and then read and critique several studies of taxation in the U.S. and other countries.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=q1KsFEbnlsUrBA6l7a3lxN1NRs5iSp8c&id=841475&ci=168590","name":"Public Sector Economics","department":"ECON","course_num":4160,"before":[{"source":"ECON:3150","target":"ECON:4160"},{"source":"ECON:3100","target":"ECON:4160"}],"after":[]},"ECON:4800":{"courseID":"ECON:4800","description":"Econometrics is the application of statistics to problems in empirical economics.

Using real data, students will learn and use econometric methods for testing theories and making predictions. The empirical problems that are investigated vary from year to year.

Students read and discuss accounts by professional writers, student writers, teachers of writing, and writing researchers. The discipline of composition studies, as well as reflections by writers on writing, is rich with interesting documentation, important theory, and vigorous dialogue. Students write for an audience to read and respond, in a broad variety of genres including the personal essay, the poem, short fiction, short nonfiction, the letter, the one-pager, and an experimental blur of genres. Writing is one tool for working out thinking. It is a link between inner speech and a frame for talk, a link between writer\/speakers and reader\/listeners. It is a writing teacher's responsibility to create an environment that ensures a diet of varied writing and broad reading, a community of rich, specific responders, and lots of opportunities for revising and careful editing. Along with the development of the individual writer-reader, the \"social construction of knowledge\" is an important concept in a writing class, and students experience it in this course. There are no actual stages, there is no specific process, but we can describe and theorize about prewriting techniques, revision strategies, conferencing models, inventories of grammatical conventions and mechanics, and publishing opportunities. Describing writing allows us to freeze the action to discover conditions under which writing takes place, and what the differences are in every writer's approach. To teach writing, you need to see that the act of writing is different with each piece you write, that you contribute to the next piece you write with each piece you read.\nEnglish majors may apply this course to the following area and\/or period requirement. Area: Nonfiction and Creative Writing.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=eic-8PJhdf3r-j70I_Jp6N1NRs5iSp8c&id=836092&ci=155401","name":"Approaches to Teaching Writing","department":"EDTL","course_num":4355,"before":[],"after":[]},"EDTL:4394":{"courseID":"EDTL:4394","description":"Contact Student Services (N310 LC) to override restriction.

The displacement of the water generates long wavelength wave trains that have little effect in the open ocean, but can produce devastating coastal \"waves\" when they encounter land.\u00a0 We will begin by examining the cause and effects of several catastrophic tsunamis such as the 2011 Tohoku Tsunami that devastated coastal areas of eastern Japan in 2011, the Indian Ocean Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004, the Good Friday Tsunami in 1964, and the April Fools Day Tsunami in 1946. The Boxing Day Tsunami is one of the largest natural disasters in recorded history. It produced waves 100 feet high that killed nearly 230,000 people in coastal areas throughout the Indian Ocean. The 2011 Tohoku Tsunami was also an unusually large tsunami, with waves up to 40 ft high, more than 19,000 deaths, and destruction of many coastal towns in eastern Japan. This tsunami also cut off power to the Fukushima nuclear power plant, which led to a major nuclear accident. More typical are the Good Friday Tsunami that struck Crescent City, California (289 buildings destroyed, 12 fatalities) and the April Fools Day Tsunami that struck Hilo, Hawaii, ($26 million damage, 159 deaths). Then we will discuss how accurate real-time forecasts of tsunamis are made, examine how tsunami hazards are assessed, review other less common causes of tsunamis, look at the social\/economic impacts of tsunamis and examine how tsunamis are depicted in Hollywood movies.\u00a0 The final weeks of class will be devoted to student presentations on a topic of their choice that somehow involves tsunamis.\u00a0 Grades will be based on participation in discussions, short writing assignments, and the presentation.","hours":1.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=eQdjn3yw5QLhnZHhH0uphiLNcIFn7jMF&id=840886&ci=168058","name":"First-Year Seminar                                            Tsunamis: Deadly Waves of Destruction","department":"EES","course_num":1000,"before":[],"after":[]},"EES:1040":{"courseID":"EES:1040","description":null,"hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=Y5QzjwkYSslcAoRpU_KPbzOkknQ0jZgB&id=840905&ci=168079","name":"Evolution and the History of Life","department":"EES","course_num":1040,"before":[],"after":[]},"EES:1050":{"courseID":"EES:1050","description":"This course is intended for science majors, honor students, and others with a strong interest in geology.

Environmental Science has the applied goal of solving environmental problems, drawing upon knowledge in disciplines as diverse as ecology, anthropology, economics, and political science. The specific student learning outcomes for the overall course are:\n\nAbility to critically evaluate popular media articles related to Environmental Science;\nAbility to locate and interpret data relevant to Environmental Science and interpret it;\nUnderstanding the relationship between their day-to-day life and Environmental Science, particularly in the context of sustainability;\nRecognize the multi-faceted nature of Environmental Science.\n\nThis course is taught in a blended environment, including traditional lectures, discussion periods in TILE classrooms, online learning, and both individual and group projects.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=tDVXjNbS0BbwM46ZVqJnnENogOgZq1a8&id=834037&ci=168080","name":"Introduction to Environmental Science","department":"EES","course_num":1080,"before":[],"after":[]},"EES:1085":{"courseID":"EES:1085","description":null,"hours":4.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=VTmzXl-FQUclF8eMFyiPVgjgExJAf2fj&id=837283&ci=169988","name":"Fundamentals of Environmental Science","department":"EES","course_num":1085,"before":[],"after":[]},"EES:1090":{"courseID":"EES:1090","description":null,"hours":1.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=ElljGsurCuAMxFq7_jLz7F41ufakJzRM&id=857254&ci=168061","name":"Intro to Environmental Sciences Lab","department":"EES","course_num":1090,"before":[],"after":[]},"EES:1115":{"courseID":"EES:1115","description":"This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n\u00a0\nAs part of the University of Iowa\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the \u201cAge of Petroleum,\u201d an age in which we continue to live.\n\u00a0\nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years? What were the factors behind oil\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth\u2019s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for \u201cHistorical Perspectives,\u201d students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas.

Given that intimacy typically signals close proximity\u2014 both emotionally and physically\u2014 this is unsurprising. Such proximity also suggests a kind of sharing, of knowledge in particular, which in turn breeds intimate relations. In this course, we will explore the various ways in which intimacy functions as a kind of knowledge about peoples and bodies in relation to one another. Broad questions we will investigate include: How and when do we mark an experience as intimate? Who gets to have certain kinds of intimate experiences, but not others? Where is intimacy permissible and where is it not? What other modes of being in relation can be claimed as intimate? Can fear, shame, and anxiety be counted as felt states of intimacy? On a smaller scale, this will include investigating the reading experience itself as one that generates a kind of intimate knowledge: about ourselves and potentially about other people, too. In turn, we will work through the process of writing as a kind of intimate exchange between ourselves as writers and the texts we read. Speaking in a practical sense, one of main goals will be to improve our reading and writing skills by thinking critically about what writers put on a page and the effects of those choices.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nRequired Texts, available at Prairie Lights:\nThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale 978-0385490818\nDon\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely 978-1555974077  Winesburg, Ohio 978-0140186550","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=0fFqLAndHu-JxtbCCPp33d1NRs5iSp8c&id=831844&ci=149065","name":"The Interpretation of Literature                                            Intimate Knowledges","department":"ENGL","course_num":1200,"before":[],"after":[]},"ENGL:1350":{"courseID":"ENGL:1350","description":"In 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court granted same-sex couples the right to marry in Obergefell v.

Working with Adrienne Rich\u2019s Poetry and Commitment and Muriel Rukeyser\u2019s The Life of Poetry, we examine such themes as the politics of difference, issues of gender, the historical self, the construction of race and the crisis of the environment. This course argues for the necessity of poetry in a complicated and fractured world. Course requirements will include a response journal, a series of take home quizzes and writing assignments and active and engaged participation in class discussions.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=5cShLlBlis6mzTzgpJj_2HpdHXxZWaha&id=837504&ci=170091","name":"Reading and Writing About Poetry                                            Words that Matter","department":"ENGL","course_num":2013,"before":[],"after":[]},"ENGL:2014":{"courseID":"ENGL:2014","description":"This course focuses on how we interpret short fiction and how we write critical essays about it.

AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies. PERIOD: 20th\/21st century literature for Fall 2017.\nIn a June 1959 Playboy article titled, \u201cThe Origins of the Beat Generation,\u201d Jack Kerouac defined the modern Beats as wise men of few words, accompanied by women of fewer, writing: \u201cThe \u2018cool\u2019 (hipster) today is your bearded laconic sage, or schlerm, before a hardly touched beer in a beatnik dive, whose speech is low and unfriendly, whose girls say nothing and wear black.\u201d Traditionally, critics have understood the position of women within the Beat community as peripheral, marking the literary \u201cboy gang\u201d of writers as a self-sustaining homosocial artistic community. For many years, with the notable exception of Diane di Prima, few women writers gained recognition as part of this literary movement, but in recent decades, memoirs by Beat women have spurred feminist recovery efforts to set the record straight. In this course, we will consider the place of these women writers within the Beat canon. We will first begin the semester by defining \u201cBeat\u201d together, focusing on work by foundational Beat writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs. Next, we will turn to memoirs written by the women of the Beat Generation to consider the role of this genre within reconstructions of the Beat canon. Finally, we will examine fiction and poetry by these women writers, thinking about how our definitions of \u201cBeat\u201d change by broadening the term to encompass these works, as well as drawing connections between these writers\u2019 aesthetics and stories.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=4SlpMYzHXQuv3VY2Jh5jvmlIsIVeWhWC&id=843160&ci=154538","name":"Literature, Culture, and Women                                            Women Writers of the Beat Movement","department":"ENGL","course_num":2193,"before":[],"after":[]},"ENGL:2309":{"courseID":"ENGL:2309","description":"Author of some of the best-loved poems in English, the Romantic poet William Wordsworth (1770-1850) became a true literary celebrity in his day, drawing both fawning adulation and some of the most vicious reviews imaginable.

Not only has the illness redefined our understanding of gender and sexuality but\u2014as a sexually transmitted disease\u2014HIV\/AIDS has also required us to examine cultural taboos and stigmas. Short stories and novels, feature films and documentaries can help us better comprehend the psychological, cultural, political and historical dimensions of a pandemic that continues to influence life in the twenty-first century.\nIn this class, we will focus on how African writers and directors have imaginatively engaged with a medical disease such as HIV\/AIDS. To what extent do their stories expose and manipulate the stigma and prejudice associated with a sexually transmitted disease? What populations appear especially vulnerable to the disease and its social and economic consequences? How are local communities and governmental institutions involved in shaping responses to HIV\/AIDS? How is a medical disease metaphorically appropriated to serve as a general symbol for the challenges of modern life? While this class emphasizes African stories about HIV\/AIDS, we will also have an opportunity to reflect on the situation of HIV-positive populations in the United States and engage in a dialogue with people living with the disease.\nCourse requirements include regular attendance and active participation, a portfolio with responses to the assigned materials, one short paper and a final (critical or creative) project.

In late twentieth and early twenty-first century fiction, films, and television, zombies are everywhere. Why? And what cultural functions does this pervasive metaphor serve? Indeed, is the zombie metaphor the perfect emblem for the salient concerns of postmodernism, combining as it does a critique of mass consumerism with fears of contagion and the breakdown of technocultural control, while providing an all-purpose scapegoat for a wide range of bigotries?\nThis course will be grounded in the reading of a range of print zombie narratives, including comics, novels, and ephemera.

It will consider the phenomenon of zombie video games and zombie-themed creations on the web.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nPopular culture has always found ways to tap and reflect our secret fears and desires and then to increasingly colonize the public imaginary.

Sometimes these needs were met by\u00a0so-called \u201csoft\u201d science fiction, based around social rather than empirical sciences, and sometimes this meant classic storylines given a new twist--alien encounters defined less by technological differences and more by psychological ones, the colonization of planets complicated\u00a0less by\u00a0resource concerns\u00a0and more by\u00a0ethical ones.

The appearance of revolutionary movements and secular political parties helped usher in the modern age. Edmund Spenser, Ben Jonson, Andrew Marvell, and John Dryden did not view these events from a distant gallery but actively involved themselves in politics, which penetrated into almost every corner of their world, including religion, literature, trade, and the role of women. By cutting across traditional literary periods the course opens new perspectives on four poetic careers as they took place over time and in history.   The goal of the course is to study four poetic careers as they unfold in specific political contexts: Spenser's celebration of Queen Elizabeth and her Irish policies; Jonson's status as a remnant of Elizabethan culture and publicist for the Stuart myth; Marvell's experimentation with various poetic styles, culminating in a densely allusive topical satire; and Dryden's attempts to shape public opinion and follow the migrations of power throughout his life.\u00a0\nRequirements include two papers (50%); two quizzes (10% each); an in-class presentation (10%); attendance and participation (20%)\nRequired Texts\u00a0\n\nR.O.

As the story goes, Shakespeare heard of the rendezvous and usurped Burbage\u2019s place with the punchline that \u201cWilliam the Conqueror was before Richard III.\u201d This apocryphal story shows how strangely seductive the character of Richard III was, despite\u2014or perhaps because of\u2014his unrelenting evil, manifested in his disfigured body. As the recent global media frenzy over the rediscovery of the historical Richard\u2019s skeleton (buried beneath a parking lot) shows, Richard remains an undeniably attractive figure for us. Indeed, audiences and readers continue to be drawn to the greatest villains in Shakespeare\u2019s works.\nThis course will attempt to explain our ongoing fascination with Shakespeare\u2019s villains by defining, re-defining, and upending our notions of what constitutes villainy. Characters like Richard III and Iago have long embodied and epitomized the Shakespearean villain\u2014but the role of the villain, and even the term \u201cvillain,\u201d were far more complicated. As such, we will focus not only on plays that feature famous villains, but on unexpected plays that will force us to reconsider what villainy meant for Shakespeare\u2014and what it continues to mean for us.\nWe will spend much of our time reading the plays closely and critically, in order to become both familiar and comfortable with reading Shakespeare\u2019s dynamic language. We will also learn about the professional theatre in which Shakespeare worked, and in which his plays were first staged, as well as the ways these plays have been performed, altered, and adapted over the subsequent centuries. We will encounter and use supplementary readings, online resources, and film versions that contextualize and galvanize the plays.\nCourse requirements will include active engagement in class discussion; a series of short exercises and writing assignments; and an individual critical or creative project. Readings will include Richard III, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, and Macbeth.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=wD5JmPyCyOYzUECtnBIVC7XZMu7NiOk4&id=836640&ci=154512","name":"Shakespeare                                            Shakespeare's Villains","department":"ENGL","course_num":3287,"before":[],"after":[]},"ENGL:3339":{"courseID":"ENGL:3339","description":"The nineteenth century was an era of major changes in British life--in industry, science, education, transportation, technology, women\u2019s roles, and political inclusion.

We will, of course, read the novel ourselves, and then we will use our resulting conversations (e.g., Are Democrats and Republicans not that different after all? Does great writing transcend ideology?) as a springboard for surveying subsequent classic (e.g., Catch-22, The Things They Carried, In Country) and contemporary (e.g., Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk, Sand Queen, Sparta, War Porn) American writing about war. Our primary focus will be fiction, but we certainly won\u2019t rule out making brief excursions into nonfiction and poetry to broaden our understanding of the forms that this writing takes.

In the process we should gain some insight into the benefits and limitations of diverse critical approaches employed by the scholars whose analyses we read, be they feminist or formalist, Marxist or psychoanalytic, or something else entirely.

There is the historical William Shakespeare, native of Stratford-upon-Avon: a player, a poet, and a playwright (not to mention a successful speculator in real estate). There are also the works of Shakespeare: the poems and plays that first earned him a reputation that, like those poems and plays, would be made and remade, adapted and amended for centuries to come. Then there is \u201cShakespeare,\u201d a cultural icon and a global phenomenon (not to mention a successful brand). And there is the Shakespeare who inhabits the very center of our literary canon and our curriculum, transcending period boundaries and academic disciplines, ineluctably (if at times infuriatingly) influencing the ways in which we interpret and define literary activity itself.\nThis course provides an advanced introduction to all of the various versions of Shakespeare. We will spend much of our time situating Shakespeare and his works in the context of early modern England, focusing on the theatre industry in which he worked, the political and religious debates in which he intervened, the burgeoning literary culture in which he wrote, the marketplace of print that made his fame, the textual environment in which he existed (and was transformed), and the subsequent critical industry that he continues to both inspire and authorize. We will engage closely with the poems and plays, along with a wide range of critical and historical material. In addition, we will use many of the powerful digital tools that now exist for the study of Shakespeare and his age. As such, this course will also provide an introduction to early modern studies\u2014to the major issues at stake, and more importantly to the potential of what is one of the most exciting (and technologically sophisticated) areas of literary study. The goal is to engage with a variety of approaches that will strengthen and enrich your own research and teaching.\nThe course requirements will include a variety of short research and writing assignments, culminating in a paper suitable to be delivered at a conference.

Writing assignments build toward the final assignment of a complete strategic plan for a real or possible nonprofit, while discussion forums engage students in conversations about the application of course concepts.\nCharitable nonprofit organizations build communities through the efforts of individual citizens, making life better for everyone. Nonprofit organizations may center on religion, health, social services, education, culture, community development, housing, or human rights. Although national and international nonprofit organizations are often huge, most nonprofits are small and focused on specific locales. The local nonprofits frequently are financially precarious and need the most support, but they also can have direct impact in communities across the nation.\nAt the conclusion of this course, NOE I students will be able to understand the role nonprofit play in improving and enhancing community life; identify the specific management skills needed for the effective day-to-day operation of nonprofit organizations; discuss the critical role mission statements and strategic planning play in the long-term success of nonprofit organizations; and develop and manage financial resources of nonprofit organizations.

What were the factors behind oil\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth\u2019s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for \u201cHistorical Perspectives,\u201d students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas. The major graded assignments consist of three exams, class participation and discussion, and a research paper.\nThis section of the course is reserved for students who also enroll for the associated section of Honors Rhetoric using One-Click Course Combinations, Courses in Common.

The students will work in groups of two and present their understanding and criticism of the assigned articles. This will be accompanied by the instructor\u2019s own views. The students will benefit in the following ways by taking this course. First, they will understand isolated features of the financial marketplace and the economy. Second, they will understand what a finance major is all about and whether it is right for them. Third, they will understand a few basics of personal investments that will help them in life even if they do not take another finance course.

Many of the traditional methods for financial professionals to complete work assignments have changed dramatically requiring skills that range from data acquisition to data analysis and synthesis. The purpose of this class is to provide exposure and practice basic tools that are needed to become proficient with a number of important finance technologies. The goal is to provide a solid grounding in the core principles of finance so that students can be successful in their careers and in managing their personal finances. To reinforce these key ideas in our electives, specially crafted applications and cases are used to strengthen understanding of critical concepts. These cases allow students to see how core concepts are applied to actual problems. By working through applications, students learn the material better and have a greater appreciation of existing models.

First, to study the major works and authors of 19th-Century France in their historical and cultural contexts, focusing on their relationship to literary movements: Romanticism, Realism, the Fantastic and Naturalism. Second, to provide an introduction to literary criticism and theory by reading seminal essays on the analysis of stories, primarily from structuralism and Russian formalism, in order to learn a variety of methodologies for approaching narrative prose.\nIn our discussions, we will ponder some of the following questions: How does theory\/criticism define literature as a category or object of study? How are narratives constructed\u2014what are their elements? How do characters develop? What is the role of description in narrative? What constitutes an action or event, and what forms a plot? How does the focalizer function in direct and indirect discourse? To what extent are scientific or rational discourses adopted or rejected? What is the impact of the Industrial Revolution on literature? How do artistic trends, such as Realist painting, influence literature of this period? How does the rise of modernity, especially the dissemination of technological innovations, transform representations of reality? Finally, to what extent do these narratives conform to the structuralist concepts used to analyze them, and which textual elements resist inclusion in a narratological framework?\nStudents will be required to participate actively in class discussions, write weekly response papers, take three exams, and present an MLA-style paper (10 pages, double-spaced) to the class.

What were the factors behind oil\u2019s emergence as the world\u2019s main transportation fuel, a chief source of heat and electricity, and the building block for a proliferating array of consumer goods? How and why did struggles over oil become central to world politics and shape the rise and fall of nations? How do we wrestle with the trade-offs between the unprecedented wealth and prosperity generated by oil development and the social, economic, and environmental costs that have come with it? How has the search for oil fostered human awareness of both Earth\u2019s deep history and the fragility of ecosystems on which we depend?\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nStudents completing this class will gain a solid foundation in the history and science of oil. Both fields emphasize the importance of thinking historically, developing explanations for why the past unfolded as it did, rather than along an alternative path. In this class, which fulfills a general education requirement for \u201cHistorical Perspectives,\u201d students study both primary and secondary sources to learn to do the work of professional historians. As oil development increasingly impacts our lives, this course is also designed to expand your understanding of the costs and benefits of oil to modern society and prepare you to confront the challenges of ensuring energy sustainability over the long run. This course will also serve as a gateway for further study in History or Earth and Environmental sciences, as well as in other energy and sustainability-related courses at the University of Iowa.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nInstruction combines a mixture of lectures, discussions, and inquiry-based activities in order to sharpen analytical abilities, promote teamwork, and improve oral and written expression of ideas.

Although the geographic emphasis is the U.S., policies and practices of other countries are discussed for comparison, and international implications of transport change is investigated. It is assumed that students are acquainted in general with institutions and economic relationships in transportation (such as presented in the planning course 102:260), including the government instruments applied to influence market activities in intercity transport. The course builds upon this knowledge to explore recent developments in government investment and promotion practices, such as federal highway cost allocation studies and the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21).\nThe initial portion of the course covers air, highway, and rail transport regulation and the effects of major changes in the economic regulation of those modes. Impacts on service to small communities and to persons with disabilities, the distribution of traffic among the modes, market structure, pricing and price discrimination, and innovation and technological change are discussed. Next students cover safety and environmental regulation, including transport security, environmental impact statements, environmental justice, nonattainment areas, and mitigation measures. An important current topic for investigation is the integration of environmental impact assessment in the transport planning process. In the second portion of the course, students explore finance principles, policies, and operations. Finally, students critically review proposals for change, such as revised transport programs (including state infrastructure banks, block grants, and intermodal trust funds); different methods of infrastructure finance and pricing (including possible roles for intelligent transportation systems); and privatization (including private operation of public facilities, contracts with private firms for facility maintenance, private construction and operation of toll facilities, and public-private partnerships for the joint development of land and transportation).\nStudents have the opportunity and responsibility for active participation in class discussion; each person should appear at class meetings prepared to contribute to a discussion of the week's readings.

AREA: Literary Theory and Interdisciplinary Studies. PERIOD: 20th\/21st century literature for Fall 2017.\nIn a June 1959 Playboy article titled, \u201cThe Origins of the Beat Generation,\u201d Jack Kerouac defined the modern Beats as wise men of few words, accompanied by women of fewer, writing: \u201cThe \u2018cool\u2019 (hipster) today is your bearded laconic sage, or schlerm, before a hardly touched beer in a beatnik dive, whose speech is low and unfriendly, whose girls say nothing and wear black.\u201d Traditionally, critics have understood the position of women within the Beat community as peripheral, marking the literary \u201cboy gang\u201d of writers as a self-sustaining homosocial artistic community. For many years, with the notable exception of Diane di Prima, few women writers gained recognition as part of this literary movement, but in recent decades, memoirs by Beat women have spurred feminist recovery efforts to set the record straight.

We will first begin the semester by defining \u201cBeat\u201d together, focusing on work by foundational Beat writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and William S. Burroughs.

Efficiency in written communication will be our primary goal. The above quote (sometimes called \u2018Einstein\u2019s Razor,\u2019 as it can be read as a counter\/complement to Occam\u2019s Razor), is often paraphrased and\/or misattributed as, \u201cThings should be as simple as possible, but no simpler.\u201d Curiously, Einstein didn\u2019t follow his own advice when writing his statement. When we write, however, we will always strive to do so. Along the way you will also either learn or augment the following skills: reading comprehension, rhetorical analysis, peer feedback, editing\/proofreading.  As this may be the last writing course you ever take, the intention is to give you as much as possible, as quickly as possible. The semester is broken down into three parts, each focused on writing for specific audiences you will encounter throughout your career, namely: the professional, the public, and the scientific. At the end of the course you will have compiled a portfolio of material that is immediately applicable to the next stage of your professional development.  In the first segment we will cover professional communications and official correspondence, with a focus on job and graduate applications materials (resumes, CVs, personal statements, cover letters, etc.). The second segment will cover science writing for a general audience, in other words, how to communicate what you know about the science world to those who do not share your expertise. Whether the goal is to persuade, inform, support, or refute, the necessary rhetorical elements will be addressed and reinforced. Specific techniques will be taught where needed such as formatting, supporting an argument, or creating a narrative structure for a personal essay, op eds, or article of interest. Finally, the third segment will concentrate on reading and writing in the hard sciences. We will read articles and studies such as those found in Lancet, Science, or the NEJM to break them down for content and structure, and we will develop our own original material in the form of reviews, summations, and critique. Special attention will be paid to methods of gathering, outlining, and drafting information that either illuminates and\/or argues a particular case. A classic Writers\u2019 Workshop structure will be employed, allowing authors to gain and offer written feedback throughout the semester. This course has neither tests nor quizzes.

This course is for students with an interest in learning about the Islamic civilization, the religious practices and beliefs, and\/or the history or the regions where Muslims are in the majority.\u00a0 We will examine the traditions and main social and legal institutions of Islam. Arguably, Islam, as a major system of beliefs and practices in the world, affects both Muslims and non-Muslims. Consequently, besides examining the basic tenets, texts, and ideas of the Islamic civilization, this course focuses on the variety of ways in which Muslims and non-Muslims have understood and interpreted Islam. We will review the discussions surrounding the life of the Prophet of Islam, Islamic pre-modern and modern history, the place and role of individuals and society, the legal and economic status of women, and Islamic governments and movements.

We will address specific topics such as Islamic doctrines and law, philosophy, Sufi mysticism, Islamic science and arts, gender issues, politics, the ongoing debate between modernism and traditionalism in contemporary Islamic societies, and Islam in the West. The course is ultimately an attempt to understand Islam as an idea and as a process, never as a static and crystallized snapshot of the world through the eyes of any specific group inside or outside the Muslim community.\nMinimally, students will learn basic definitions of key terms and concepts, identify major social and political trends, locate demographic and political centers within the Islamic world, understand legal and philosophical norms, contextualize historical events, expose hidden and public tensions within and without Muslim and\/or non-Muslim communities, and acquire a basic understanding of the origins, developments, and limits of the Islamic civilization.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=DTV1GFk_zm8T1ar8JChIo6FsMj6MX5YM&id=836562&ci=170540","name":"Introduction to Islamic Civilization","department":"HIST","course_num":1030,"before":[],"after":[]},"HIST:1040":{"courseID":"HIST:1040","description":"Django Unchained, Twelve Years a Slave, Nate Parker\u2019s Birth of a Nation \u2013 just a glance at recent movie titles reminds us that the history of African Americans in slavery and freedom remains a topic of public interest and debate in the twenty-first century.\u00a0 Although historians argue about how accurately and inclusively these films represent slavery and the slave experience, each film does engage with real aspects of that history.\u00a0 Husbands and wives were separated by the domestic slave trade \u2013 free blacks were kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South \u2013 enslaved men and women resisted in myriad ways, including armed rebellion.\u00a0 This course is an opportunity to learn and understand more about all of the above, while gaining a foundation in early African American history more broadly.African American History to 1877 offers a survey of African American history from African origins and the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade to emancipation and Reconstruction following the U.S. Civil War.\u00a0 Major topics will include the development of a race-based slavery in the North and South; gradual emancipation and the development of a free black community in the North; slave resistance and the black abolitionist movement; growing sectional tensions and the Civil War; and emancipation and new political rights post-1865.\u00a0 This course centers the experiences of free and enslaved African Americans, as well as their contributions to larger national debates about race and slavery in the nation.\u00a0 We will pay particular attention to the way that racial and gender ideologies shaped African American men and women\u2019s experiences in slavery and freedom.\u00a0 The course will also consider the ways that African Americans and the history of slavery are portrayed in popular culture and memory, such as the feature films mentioned above.\u00a0 Primary sources, fiction, film and documentaries, and traditional secondary sources will form the basis of our study.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=BTJqdAnljm1IqA5x2ORw6F41ufakJzRM&id=851310&ci=151246","name":"Diversity in History                                            African American History to 1877: From Slave Cabin to the Senate Floor","department":"HIST","course_num":1040,"before":[],"after":[]},"HIST:1115":{"courseID":"HIST:1115","description":"This course provides broad historical perspective on the business, science, geology, technology, politics, environment, and culture of the global oil industry.\n\u00a0\nAs part of the University of Iowa\u2019s \u201cBig Ideas\u201d curriculum, this course asks students to contemplate the big questions surrounding the origins, development, and meaning of the \u201cAge of Petroleum,\u201d an age in which we continue to live.\n\u00a0\nHow and why did oil become the most powerful international business of the last 150 years?

Any sustained war effort has important political, social, cultural, and economic implications. It shifts the priorities of political life, recasts the economy around wartime needs, and scrambles the private lives of those at home and abroad. All of this was exaggerated in the case of American participation in World War II. The sheer scale of the war effort brought with it far more profound and lasting changes than the shorter and smaller mobilization of 1917-1919. And, perhaps most importantly, the war came in a time at which the basic direction of American politics, political economy, and political culture was \"up for grabs.\" The Depression which had begun in 1929 still gripped the nation's economy, and the political response to the Depression--the New Deal--had transformed the role of the state in the economy, introduced the first hints of the modern welfare state, and changed the rules and expectations of labor relations. All of these changes were matters of fierce debate when the war came; in some respects the war suspended this debate, but in other respects it resolved it by recasting the New Deal around the assumptions of full employment and increased government spending. As students trace this and other elements of the war experience, they touch on prewar patterns, the impact and importance of the war, and the postwar situation.\u00a0\nNote: this course has proctored online exams.

Copies flew off store shelves as readers of all ages were captivated by Harry\u2019s story. It was as though the novel had been rediscovered and reading became everyone\u2019s favorite activity. Subsequent volumes continued to mesmerize readers, and soon thereafter they listened to audio versions and watched cinematic adaptations. Why was the Harry Potter series so appealing? What was it about Harry\u2019s story or that of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Dobby, or Neville Longbottom\u2019s that resonated with such a diverse populace? How and why did readers develop deep personal connections to the series? How was Pottermania created and sustained?\nIn this course we will analyze the Harry Potter series for the insights it provides on friendship, loyalty, finance, the law, social justice, ethnicity, social media, sports (Quidditch), music (The Weird Sisters), and our relationship with animals and their world. Through a close reading of the novels we will consider their place in the literary canon. We will also pinpoint where influences from this canon can be found in the novels. Finally, we will study the Harry Potter series as a cultural phenomenon. We will analyze the impact the series had on readership and popular culture in America and Great Britain.\nThis honors course is taught by lecturer Donna Parsons (http:\/\/music.uiowa.edu\/people\/donna-parsons).\u00a0If you are not a member of the University of Iowa Honors Program, you may contact the course instructor in order to request permission to enroll.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=72iJwBasP399Q_P1Gv2GzOrnvO0vVbdX&id=835266&ci=168570","name":"Hnrs Sem Literary Visual Performing Arts                                            Harry Potter and the Quest for Enlightenment","department":"HONR","course_num":1630,"before":[],"after":[]},"HONR:2800":{"courseID":"HONR:2800","description":"The Green Room: Making Your Connection\nA green room traditionally refers to a space in a theater where performers can relax and entertain visitors before taking the stage.

Through stories, speakers, reflective writing, and a series of new experiences, The Green Room asks students to explore beyond their chosen academic major.

These media interventions don\u2019t mean it\u2019s not possible to hole up in a cabin to write a perfect short story anymore, but that the texture of our reality is changing and that our writing can reflect that reality. We\u2019ll discuss how social media platforms, literary journals, self-publishing, Tumblr and other online communities, YouTube, and other innovations have allowed creative people to reach a larger audience and how this has impacted the world of creative writing.\nThis class will run as part laboratory, part salon. The ultimate goal is not for you to walk away feeling like a literary media guru, but for you to improve your creative writing chops and to have a deeper understanding of how the media has changed the face of creative writing. We\u2019ll discuss the political and ethical aspects of new media, read short fiction that pushes the boundaries of form, explore hypertext fiction, watch YouTube shows, analyze Twitter profiles, read online lit journals, and will do much more to develop a deeper understanding of how media affects creative writing today.

Religious economics is a related subject sometimes conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious principles to evaluate economic perspectives and practices. In Economics of Religion, we will draw on these and other emerging areas of inquiry to explore the origins and functions of religious economic ideas in Islamic, Christian, and Jewish societies throughout history.\n\u00a0\nSpecifically, after the financial crisis of 2008, scholars paid more attention to the role of religion in sustaining economic development and inspiring financial institutions to offer religion-compliant products and services. Limits on interest-based loans to the growing Muslim community in Western societies forced many banking and investment organization to create shari`a-compliant products and services. The success of Islamist governments in Turkey and Iran to create thriving middle and entrepreneurial classes brought to focus the relationship between religious belief and economics. Globalization, too, played a significant role in raising the profile of religion-inspired financial endeavors, services, and products. Students will be introduced to these and related themes in this highly multidisciplinary course.\n\u00a0\nThis course is about the origins, functions and impact of Islamic and other religions' ideas and practices in the realms of economic development, financial services and products, business ethics and practices, and business models. Students will explore the ways such ideas and practices affect legacy issues like property rights, poverty, and access to healthcare, education, and social security. Lastly, students will examine the impact of religious ideas and practices on social justice matters that touch on individual and group identity along class, gender, ethnicity, and race, as well as, the role of religion in formulating public policy and directing international relations.

In this sense, native speakers of English already have an instinctive knowledge of its grammar. However, the study of language enables us to externalize and formalize this instinctive knowledge and thus can help us to communicate more effectively. Quite simply, if we know how English works, then we can make better use of it.

You will be able, among other things, to characterize the differences between Standard American English and Received Pronunciation, the dialect spoken by the Queen of England.\nFurther, you will discover why you do not understand the earlier forms of English, for example, the English spoken by Geoffrey Chaucer, a 14th century English poet. It will become clear why English spelling is so hard to learn.\nWe will also look at how you vary your language depending on the situation you are in and who you talk to.

External history deals with non-linguistic events that played a role in the shaping of the English language. Internal history deals with the changes in the grammar (pronunciation, word classes, sentence structure, and vocabulary).You can learn much history through language. For example, the phrase Johnson County Sheriff is loaded with history. Johnson bears testimony to a Danish occupation of England in the 9th century. County, a French word meaning \u2018territory ruled by a count or viscount\u2019, goes back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Sheriff is a truly English word, or rather words, because it comes from shire reeve, a royal administrator of a shire, under Alfred the Great in the 9th century. Shires were replaced by counties by the Normans, but the word still survives in names, for example, (New) Hampshire.We also look at texts and analyze them. You will learn how to read Old English sentences, recite Chaucer in Middle English and read Shakespeare with a 17th century accent.

Topics include geometry of the complex plane, analytic  functions, Cauchy-Goursat theorem and applications, and Laurent series,  residues, and elementary conformal mapping.  Grades are usually based on  homework and exams, including a final.  The course is taught by a  faculty member.This is a beginning course in complex variables and their applications. We will begin with the fundamentals, comparing the more familiar cases from calculus to the setting of complex functions: Analytic and harmonic functions, contour integrals, and integral representations. Applications include those to other areas of mathematics, and to physics, and engineering.

Extrinsic properties of surfaces in Euclidean space are studied, and related to the intrinsic geometry of these surfaces. This lays the foundation for the introduction of abstract surfaces. Students also examine various curvature functions and extremal objects; for example, distance and energy minimizing curves on surfaces, and area minimizing surfaces. The aim is to reach the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem. The course may use computers (and specifically, Mathematica) as a visual tool to understand geometry intuitively. No previous knowledge of Mathematica is required, but a general familiarity with computers can be useful. The ideas from this subject have applications in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines.

Being clear about what your strengths and goals are, what motivates you, and knowing your learning style provide the foundation for effectively managing yourself in a variety of situations. Once we have uncovered some of your key attributes we will analyze how that information can best be applied to manage yourself toward greater effectiveness in achieving your goals and being successful in areas that are truly important to you. Topics include (but are not limited to) assessing your strengths, setting goals, self-control, personal finance, effective habits, communication, leadership, and mindfulness. If you want to learn to be more effective at achieving more of the goals that are important to you this course is for you.

From Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin, Patsy Cline, Janis Joplin, Chrissie Hynde and Patti Smith to Madonna, the Spice Girls, Alanis Morissette, Amy Winehouse, Lady Gaga, Pink, Beyonc\u00e9 and Adele, female performers have challenged and redefined the manner in which the music industry and fans respond to issues of gender, sexuality, identity, authenticity, and artistry. In this course students examine the history of popular women musicians and the influence their lyrics, music and performances have had on American and British culture. Concurrently students explore the impact which civil rights, the British Invasion (i.e. the Beatles and the Rolling Stones), second wave feminism, the counterculture, social injustices, war, music education, rock festivals and charity concerts have had on women\u2019s music careers.\nOur exploration cuts across cultures and ethnicity as we analyze the rise and fall of early girl groups such as the Shirelles, the Supremes, and the Ronettes, the dynamics of mixed gender groups including The Mamas and the Papas, Fleetwood Mac, Blondie, and Siouxsie Sioux and the Banshees, and the social lyricism of Joan Baez, Sin\u00e9ad O\u2019Connor, Suzanne Vega, and Tracy Chapman.

This seems to be an important question; indeed it seems to be the question, but philosophers have taken a number of different positions in attempting to answer it. In the first segment of the course, we will consider the issue of whether or not there is a connection between the value of human pursuits and the existence of God and the afterlife. In the second segment we will address the related issue of whether or not the best life is a life of hedonistic self-interest or a life that is guided by a concern for those around us. In the next segment of the course we will consider the Stoic and Buddhist view that happiness is not a matter of making things go as we please but instead is a matter of adjusting to the way that things happen inevitably and on their own. Then we will discuss what some critics have taken to be obstacles in the way of a meaningful life--for example the internet, technology, modernity, and the I-pod. The semester will conclude with a discussion of the prospect that life is just absurd. Philosophers have offered compelling insights on the different sides of these issues, and we will have a lot of discussion to try to sort it all out.

This course covers some of the main methods and principles that can be used to objectively evaluate whether an argument is good or bad. These techniques will be illustrated by considering controversial topics in ethics, science, and religion, among others. We look at how to recognize an argument before evaluating it, and Socrates' distinction between sophistry (persuasive techniques) and philosophy (rational argument). Methods for objectively evaluating deductive and inductive arguments will both be discussed. We also consider the difference between deductive proof and providing evidence for (or against) a given theory such as evolution or creationism.\nStudents who have acquired reasoning skills by learning and practicing these distinctly philosophical methods\u00a0obtain better scores on professional school entrance exams such as the LSAT, GMAT, MCAT, and GRE. These skills are extremely valuable in almost any course or job that involves creative thinking, writing and analytical work.\nThe course satisfies the General Education requirement in Quantitative and Formal Reasoning. It is also a good way of preparing for other courses in philosophy such as Introduction to Philosophy, Twentieth-Century Philosophy, Analytic Ethics, and of course Introduction to Symbolic logic (which is a requirement for a major in Philosophy).\nCoursework involves doing a relatively small amount of scheduled reading from the textbook, and discussing the homework exercises at the end of each section in the textbook.

There were particles and laws of nature, but only in ways allowed by proper conceptions of matter and causation; there was free will and agency, but only in ways allowed by a proper conception of God. The adjustment, of course, went both ways, and in particular, insights in science suggested and then guided revisions of belief in theology. In this course we examine central components of the philosophical systems of Rene Descartes, Baruch Spinoza, Nicholas Malebranche, Margaret Cavendish, Anne Conway, and G.W. Leibniz. There will be a lot of discussion of free will and human responsibility in the context of deterministic science.\u00a0 We will also consider views and arguments surrounding science v. religion, the nature and existence of God, the nature and existence of the physical world, skepticism, the place of minds in a physical universe, the limits of human cognition, and the good life.

Notice that if you push the person, you get the same consequence: \u00a0five persons live and one dies.\u00a0 Or consider a parallel medical case: If a medical team has enough time and resources to save either one person or a group of five others, but not both, it seems they should save the five; but what if they could only save the five by killing the one and using the organs to save the others? \u00a0Once again, if they do so then the consequences would be the same: five live and one dies.\u00a0 But then, why hesitate to kill the one to save the five?\nThe trolley case and other cases like it highlight a central problem in ethical theory.\u00a0 In evaluating whether an action is right or wrong, should we look only to the consequences of these actions, or is something else relevant?\u00a0 If only the consequences matter, why do we feel, at least initially, that killing the one to save the five is wrong?\u00a0 If something else is relevant, what is it, and why does it matter?\nWe make moral judgments on a regular basis in our lives, judgments to the effect that some goal or purpose is good, that some decision or action is right or wrong, or that some person is a good or bad person.\u00a0 Despite the fact that such judgment are commonly made and acted upon, and have deep and significant consequences, people rarely subject them to much critical reflection.\u00a0 We rarely ask what exactly we mean by such judgments, or on what basis they ought to be made.

We will pay particular attention to Aristotle\u2019s theory of moral knowledge and his response to questions such as the following: what is the nature of moral knowledge and how is it acquired? Is objective moral knowledge even possible? How should we respond to the moral skeptic who argues that it is not? A second major focus will be on Aristotle\u2019s virtue ethics. Virtue ethics is concerned with the kind of person you are---just, courageous, moderate with respect to bodily appetites, truthful, generous, friendly----and explains the rightness of right action in terms of such virtuous states of the person. In Aristotle\u2019s view, a virtue is a disposition of the person to act in various ways as opposed to others; such dispositions in the completely virtuous person are crucially integrated into a capacity for both practical reasoning and appropriate emotional response. We will explore how Aristotle thinks virtue is related to human flourishing (or eudaimonia, sometimes translated as \u2018happiness\u2019) and right action, and the manner in which virtue involves aspiring to an ideal. Other major topics will include Aristotle\u2019s account of the various virtues of character; his account of practical intelligence, moral deliberation, voluntary action, choice, and weakness of will; his theory of friendship; his rejection of hedonism and his metaphysically complex theory of the nature of pleasure. Along the way we will also read shorter selections from the Platonic corpus on the nature of moral knowledge, pleasure, and moral psychology, especially where Aristotle is responding to and critiquing the views of his predecessor and teacher Plato.

With\u00a0digital media, the public\u2019s demand for around the clock real-time news has skyrocketed. Over the past twenty years newsroom staff has declined by nearly 40% according to Pew, but there has been a dramatic increase in how much is written about leading 2016 presidential candidates. Donald Trump has received nearly\u00a0three times more\u00a0media attention than his opponents, equivalent to $2 billion in free media coverage, compared to $746 million for Hillary Clinton and $321 million Bernie Sanders (based on a company that uses advertising ratings to assign a dollar to the media coverage candidates receive). This is hybrid media. Trump\u2019s Twitter campaigning generates tremendous coverage by both traditional journalists and digital only media outlets, and then is consumed by readers online who want streaming news around-the clock and televisions viewers. There is blurring of digital and traditional media and a feedback loop between the two.\nThis course is about the media and politics. The U.S. Constitution\u2019s First Amendment guarantees freedom of the press, and most Americans believe that a free press is an essential condition for both liberty and democratic politics. The\u00a0media play a central role in American politics, not only in setting the agenda of topics that Americans think about and discuss but also in swaying public opinion on political issues and politicians. The course surveys the role of media in U.S. and global politics with a focus on social media. It includes two midterm exams and one take\u00a0home final.\nIn the twenty-first century information access and participation in society are increasingly digital, as news, jobs, education and politics moves online. Interactive online networking platforms such as Twitter, Facebook--are transforming politics from electoral campaigns, to democratic protests, to the news media. Social media is how many\u00a0people find the news and get informed. What are the consequences of this fundamental change in media for politics and society?\u00a0\nTopics include inequality in access to the Internet (the \"digital divide\"), hybrid media and politics (from the New York Times to Wikileaks), social media and Twitter, big data and electoral campaigns, political participation, organizing, social movements and netroots, democratic protests, security and privacy and more.\u00a0\nPolitics is about power.\u00a0Political actors who use traditional and digital media to their advantage gain power, while those less effective at the new hybrid media lose out. While social media has many benefits, it also had costs, including replicating\u00a0societal inequalities based on race and economic class, privacy and security, and reduced tolerance for others.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

Students begin by investigating four sources from which Russia\u2019s foreign policy springs: what they understand their national interests to be; their national identity as shaped by their history; the politics that produces their policies; and the capabilities Russia has to influence external events. The course then turns to case studies of Russian policy toward the United States, China and the near abroad (the former Soviet republics along Russia\u2019s borders such as Ukraine).\nUnderstanding Russia\u2019s international behavior can benefit all future citizens and should be particularly valuable for those who will go into government service, the non-profit sector, journalism, the military, or international business. Students should also leave the course more reflective about U.S. foreign policy, or the foreign policy of the country with which they are most familiar, by virtue of having learned how Russians see world affairs. \u00a0\nThis course fulfills a requirement for the following degrees or programs:\n\nPolitical Science\nInternational Relations (Regional Politics and Relationships)\nInternational Studies (Russian, East European and Eurasian)\nInternational Business Certificate (International Relations and Institutions)\n\nClass sessions will include lectures, discussions, videos and group activities. Grades will be based on a midterm, two short written assignments, class participation and a final exam.\nTextbooks: All assigned readings are available from the Main Library\u2019s Reserve Desk or are on the internet or are on the course ICON site.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=VTWYCNaMArwfmFro4bamnUNogOgZq1a8&id=840935&ci=154452","name":"Russian Foreign Policy","department":"POLI","course_num":3410,"before":[],"after":[]},"POLI:3422":{"courseID":"POLI:3422","description":"The region encompassing eight East African countries ranging from Sudan in the northwest to Kenya in the southeast presents a microcosm of policy issues of very high interest to the United States; many of these issues affect nations across Africa and elsewhere in the developing world. \u00a0This course entails multi-level analyses comparing sub-state, state, regional, and global influences on political and economic developments in these countries. \u00a0Under the rubric \u201cPirates,\u201d we will examine piracy and other transnational issues including crime, terrorism, corruption, and various anti-crime, peace-keeping, and counter-terrorism efforts. \u00a0\u201cPolitics\u201d will include a comparative look at national and sub-national political dynamics, regional interactions, and the impact of global politics on the eight states. \u00a0\u201cDevelopment\u201d will compare economic and human development across the region and examine political development concepts such as identity, secession, and legitimacy.\nStudents will garner a richer understanding of the countries in the Horn of Africa, have a clearer picture of U.S. policy concerns and interactions with regional states, and come away better equipped to do comparative analyses of other regions of the world. \u00a0The class will be highly participative. \u00a0Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, three mini-projects, and two exams. \u00a0Members of the class are encouraged to read a major national newspaper and The Economist regularly.\nStudents, particularly juniors and seniors, of all majors are welcomed in the course.

This has ranged from documentaries about wars and battles, historical fiction, dramas, comedies, dramadies, to dark comedies and satire. These films have also emerged from, and been produced by individuals from several different cultures. This class will explore how diverse films examine, represent, and interrogate war. We will watch films like the Battle of Algiers (a historical war film about France\u2019s efforts to stop urban terrorism in Algeria), Saving Private Ryan (historical fiction that realistically portrays combat in World War 2), Thirteen Days (a historical thriller about the Cuban Missile Crisis), 300 (a fictionalized account of a\u00a0famous ancient\u00a0battle), Tropic Thunder (a dark and satirical comedy about war movies themselves), and others. Assigned readings will help guide discussions about how these films portray\u00a0particular themes of warfare. For example, we will read a book chapter about representations of \"buddies\" in war and then explore how 300 examines camaraderie and courage in battles, drawing on scenes depicting how King Leonidas treats the disabled Ephialtes and the\u00a0structure and strategy of the military phalanx).

familiarize students with multivariate methods in such a way that awareness of the foundations of techniques is developed as well as appreciation for practical applications.\u00a0 A major goal of instruction is that students develop a sufficient conceptual foundation in multivariate methods to evaluate literature that uses these techniques as welll as grasp basic ideas behind methods not specifically covered in this course.\u00a0 Because a primary goal of the course is that students understand how multivariate methods work, the use of \"canned\" statistical routines will be avoided in the beginning of the course.\u00a0 Instead, students will be provided with sample computer programs that use matrix routines from SAS's PROC IML, and may use them to perform the more rudimentary techniques in multivariate analysis.\u00a0 This merely uses a computer as a giant calculator; no original programming is required.\u00a0 The examples from IML will be complemented by illustrations from pre-packaged procedures to facilitate interpretation of essential information from PROC GLM and PROC ANOVA.\u00a0 We will use packaged programs in SAS for the more complex techniques of DA, CFA,

William., Rollnick, Stephen (2002) Motivational Interviewing Second Edition\nCourse Description: This course will define and address the fundamental concepts of Motivational Interviewing and the Stages of Change model. The use of these approaches with particular emphasis on persons with substance use disorders will be explored. This course will teach that Motivational Interviewing is a style of working with persons with addictive behavior disorders designed to increase motivation for change. This course will teach students to match interventions to six stages of readiness-for-change. It will emphasize motivational strategies that include how to help the client\/patient resolve ambivalence impasses that impede change, how to draw upon internal motivation to work in a positive direction and how to remove obstacles to change. A combination of lecture, readings, videos, large and small group discussion will be used to advance students knowledge and understanding of Motivational Interviewing. In addition, heavy emphasis is placed on classroom discussion and role-play activities\nClass Attendance Policy: students are expected to attend class. Points will be tabulated for attendance; attendance at each class is worth 2.5 points, equaling a total of 35 points.\nLearning Environment Expectations: students are responsible for material covered in class as well as assigned material. If students miss a class it is expected that they will still be responsible for the covered material. Students are expected to come to class prepared.\nCourse Requirements:  regularly attend class, participate and contribute to classroom discussion; one exam = 150 points, small group classroom presentations =125 points, classroom participation = 30 points; attendance = 35 points; small group activities; small group presentations = 125 points. Students will randomly be assigned one of the Stages of Change from the Stages of Change Model. A classroom presentation will be expected of each small group.\nCourse Objectives: by the end of this course, students will demonstrate knowledge of: the conceptual and research background supporting MI, the concept of ambivalence and the critical conditions necessary for change, the guiding principles of MI and a practical description of the approach, knowledge of specific strategies for building motivation and strengthening commitment to change, and knowledge of MI and the Stages-of-Change model; application with various populations\nEvaluation Procedures:  active participation is mandatory for the full realization of the course goals. In order to pass the course, the following expectations must be met: all reading assignments completed before class time; active involvement in class discussion, note taking, small group activities; completion of required one (1) exam; full participation and involvement in your assigned small group classroom presentation; and adherence to attendance requirement.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=0EnyjYtIffkA29gfamroZR01o3BB_hSW&id=835534&ci=157914","name":"Motivational Interviewing                                            Helping People Prepare for Change","department":"RCE","course_num":4175,"before":[],"after":[]},"RCE:4176":{"courseID":"RCE:4176","description":"This course is designed for students pursuing careers in education, health science, counseling, law, social work, juvenile justice, psychology and other fields where knowledge about child abuse and advocating for children will be helpful. \u00a0This course provides the knowledge and skills necessary to recognize and assess child abuse and neglect, and to intervene effectively on behalf of children. \u00a0Guest speakers represent various components of the child welfare system in Iowa. \u00a0Mandatory Reporter training will be included. \u00a0\n\u00a0This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

This course is for students with an interest in learning about the Islamic civilization, the religious practices and beliefs, and\/or the history or the regions where Muslims are in the majority.\u00a0 We will examine the traditions and main social and legal institutions of Islam. Arguably, Islam, as a major system of beliefs and practices in the world, affects both Muslims and non-Muslims. Consequently, besides examining the basic tenets, texts, and ideas of the Islamic civilization, this course focuses on the variety of ways in which Muslims and non-Muslims have understood and interpreted Islam. We will review the discussions surrounding the life of the Prophet of Islam, Islamic pre-modern and modern history, the place and role of individuals and society, the legal and economic status of women, and Islamic governments and movements. As a survey course, we will examine these topics through an interdisciplinary approach: we will apply textual, legal\/normative, anthropological, geographical, sociological, analytical, linguistic, and historical methodologies.\u00a0\nOne of the aims of this course is to give voice to Islamic texts and provide a window into how Muslims, in varying socio-historical contexts, view themselves and how they view others. We will address specific topics such as Islamic doctrines and law, philosophy, Sufi mysticism, Islamic science and arts, gender issues, politics, the ongoing debate between modernism and traditionalism in contemporary Islamic societies, and Islam in the West. The course is ultimately an attempt to understand Islam as an idea and as a process, never as a static and crystallized snapshot of the world through the eyes of any specific group inside or outside the Muslim community.\nMinimally, students will learn basic definitions of key terms and concepts, identify major social and political trends, locate demographic and political centers within the Islamic world, understand legal and philosophical norms, contextualize historical events, expose hidden and public tensions within and without Muslim and\/or non-Muslim communities, and acquire a basic understanding of the origins, developments, and limits of the Islamic civilization.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=hK72JJuX6TE3MBgn7UvvyzOkknQ0jZgB&id=836562&ci=155914","name":"Introduction to Islamic Civilization","department":"RELS","course_num":1130,"before":[],"after":[]},"RELS:1225":{"courseID":"RELS:1225","description":"This course explores European religion, principally Western Christianity, and its broader cultural setting from the end of antiquity to the eve of the Reformation (ca. 1500).\u00a0 It examines beliefs and practices among the intellectual and social elite as well as the meaning of religion for the largely illiterate and unlearned majority of the population.\u00a0 Topics also include the role of women, religious opposition, the place of the liturgy, religious art and architecture, politics and religion, and the syncretic blend of \u201cofficial\u201d and folk religion.\u00a0 Three examinations and three short papers.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=Lppwg4UdWgmo8d862M4cAENogOgZq1a8&id=843284&ci=154897","name":"Medieval Religion and Culture","department":"RELS","course_num":1225,"before":[],"after":[]},"RELS:1702":{"courseID":"RELS:1702","description":"Have you ever been curious about what and why people believe?

How this point is exploited is examined in Hemingway's The Old Man and the Sea, Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilych,\" Clarke's Childhood's End, the Book of Ecclesiastes, the E'numa E'lish, and Stanley Kubrick's film, 2001: A Space Odyssey.\nUpon completing this course, students should be able to (a) reflect on how various quests for meaning in life as expressed in literature relate to the human condition, with particular attention to matters relating to the table, the bedroom, and the grave; (b) specify the dangers in making generalizations about biblical texts and the individuals and groups that hold them to be sacred; (c) indicate how fundamental human questions such as \"Where do we come from?\", \"Where are we going?\", and \"How long do we have?\" are expressed from the contrasting viewpoints of the pagan and biblical visions.\nIn addition to reading materials and interactive tools, online content includes audio slideshows and video (recorded class lectures of Professor Jay Holstein); evaluation consists of one writing assignment and online assessments by way of multiple-choice quizzes, midterm, and final exams, all of which are accessed in the ICON course management system.

From the earliest generations, Christians debated and fought over such issues as the exact nature of Jesus, whether or not they had to be Jewish, and even whether it was the teaching or the death of Jesus that brought salvation. In an age of sectarian dispute, how could you know which group had the \u201ctrue\u201d message and path to salvation? Since Jesus wrote nothing himself, authority was sought through his apostles and closest associates. And, since they did not have armies, their battles over authority were waged through narratives.

Religious economics is a related subject sometimes conflated with the economics of religion. It uses religious principles to evaluate economic perspectives and practices. In Economics of Religion, we will draw on these and other emerging areas of inquiry to explore the origins and functions of religious economic ideas in Islamic, Christian, and Jewish societies throughout history.\n\u00a0\nSpecifically, after the financial crisis of 2008, scholars paid more attention to the role of religion in sustaining economic development and inspiring financial institutions to offer religion-compliant products and services. Limits on interest-based loans to the growing Muslim community in Western societies forced many banking and investment organization to create shari`a-compliant products and services. The success of Islamist governments in Turkey and Iran to create thriving middle and entrepreneurial classes brought to focus the relationship between religious belief and economics. Globalization, too, played a significant role in raising the profile of religion-inspired financial endeavors, services, and products. Students will be introduced to these and related themes in this highly multidisciplinary course.\n\u00a0\nThis course is about the origins, functions and impact of Islamic and other religions' ideas and practices in the realms of economic development, financial services and products, business ethics and practices, and business models. Students will explore the ways such ideas and practices affect legacy issues like property rights, poverty, and access to healthcare, education, and social security. Lastly, students will examine the impact of religious ideas and practices on social justice matters that touch on individual and group identity along class, gender, ethnicity, and race, as well as, the role of religion in formulating public policy and directing international relations.

The Defense Language Institute classifies Russian as a \u201cLevel III\u201d language, meaning it has a very high degree of difficulty and requires 789 or more hours of immersive instruction to attain intermediate fluency (See \u201cRussian Life\u201d May\/June 2009). It means, in order to master Russian, you need to get more hours, combining your work in class with homework.\u00a0 The course is focused on the basic skills to achieve successful communication: pronunciation, vocabulary, listening, speaking, reading, and writing. You will sing the Russian songs, memorize the Russian words and write dictations, listen to real Russian dialogues and monologues, discuss, play out the situations, play games, learn to tell Russian jokes (anekdoty), and will write various kinds of essays.

When the Spaniards arrived in 1519, Mexico-Tenochtitlan was among the largest urban centers in the world. The Aztec capital stunned the conquistadors with its size and beauty: built across islands in an interlocking system of alpine lakes at the bottom of a wide basin formed by smoking volcanoes, it was a tropical Venice in the New World. The city's stunning surroundings famously led the Mexican intellectual Alfonso Reyes to dub his nation's capital \"la regi\u00f3n m\u00e1s transparente.\" During its long history, Mexico City has been repeatedly transformed. The lakes were largely drained over the course of many decades. Industrialization and huge traffic snarls have choked the air. Throughout, Mexico City has been a global city and a place where Spanish American cultural life has flowed and left indelible marks. This class will make a broad historical overview of Mexico City. Readings and materials will include first-person narratives by Spanish conquistadors, texts by colonial and native intellectuals, and work by more contemporary writers, such as short stories, novels, essays, and journalistic pieces as well as works by musicians and filmmakers.

After a careful consideration of a number of fundamental terms and principles, students examine approximately 16 important dramatic texts, each one embodying a different approach to dramatic structure.  Of special concern is the status these plays have as blueprints for performances that occur before audiences in space and in time.  The dual objectives of the course are to develop basic skills in the critical reading and close analysis of dramatic texts with respect to issues of structure, and to exercise our imaginations with respect to the potential challenges of putting these texts into production.","hours":3.0,"href":"https:\/\/myui.uiowa.edu\/my-ui\/courses\/details.page?_ticket=ExH_k3W_chlJLH3rDFtjgTCtfNMxRz94&id=831306&ci=148179","name":"Script Analysis","department":"THTR","course_num":2402,"before":[],"after":[]},"THTR:2411":{"courseID":"THTR:2411","description":"Focusing on the romantic and rebellious impulses of theatre artists and audiences, this course explores how plays in performance have both revolutionized and reinforced social structures, perceptions, and values from the early modern era to the present.

In addition to absorbing large-scale concepts of craft (e.g. dialogue, description, figurative language), you will learn helpful tips and tricks to improve your writing style (e.g. how to thwart punctuation errors, how to improve transitions between paragraphs).

External history deals with non-linguistic events that played a role in the shaping of the English language. Internal history deals with the changes in the grammar (pronunciation, word classes, sentence structure, and vocabulary).You can learn much history through language. For example, the phrase Johnson County Sheriff is loaded with history. Johnson bears testimony to a Danish occupation of England in the 9th century. County, a French word meaning \u2018territory ruled by a count or viscount\u2019, goes back to the Norman invasion of England in 1066. Sheriff is a truly English word, or rather words, because it comes from shire reeve, a royal administrator of a shire, under Alfred the Great in the 9th century. Shires were replaced by counties by the Normans, but the word still survives in names, for example, (New) Hampshire.We also look at texts and analyze them. You will learn how to read Old English sentences, recite Chaucer in Middle English and read Shakespeare with a 17th century accent.

Through a combination of guided study and hands-on service work, students will create lesson plans, direct activities, and help produce a group publication for a group of young writers at a local school or community center.\nThe course offers three semester hours of credit, broken down as follows. For one hour per week, students will meet in small groups at their chosen community sites to facilitate workshops, lessons, and activities for the youth they\u2019ve elected to serve.

What is the connection between literacy and social justice? What does it mean to become a community builder, and how can a student most effectively and thoughtfully connect with youth of diverse backgrounds?

In this course, students will be guided by a series of prompts, readings, and targeted assignments that will lead to a shared final goal: an online portfolio of writing that highlights the work created (and the skills gained) while pursuing the Certificate in Writing.\nThough specific content will be unique to each student's individual project, every enrolled member of this course will be required to: draft a capstone \u300croadmap\u300d proposal, substantially revise one portfolio piece to underscore improved writing skills, draft one entirely new piece of writing that connects to the larger themes of the portfolio, create a web-based hosting platform for the capstone project, complete a \u300cCapstone Introduction\u300d reflection that prepares readers to engage with the portfolio, and submit a link to the final project by the last day of classes.\nIn addition to these requirements, throughout the term students will be asked to read and respond to published pieces, participate in peer-review sessions, and generate multiple reflections as they progress with their project. Students can expect to get feedback from their instructor on revisions and drafts, and the instructor will also be available for on-campus and online office hours.\nThis is an exciting and rewarding class, but it's important to remind students that the value of their experience (and their grade) will depend greatly on their own commitment to meet deadlines and participate to their fullest extent.This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.

We\u2019ll begin by looking at syntax and grammar, moving from simple subject-verb-object sentences to multi-clausal juggernauts. Once we\u2019ve mastered the basics of how sentences are put together, we\u2019ll start reading different authors to develop a taste for sentence style. We\u2019ll study long sentences and short sentences, lyrical sentences and satirical sentences, oratorical sentences and expository sentences, always with an eye for what makes them interesting or beautiful. With weekly writing assignments you\u2019ll craft each of these sentence types yourself, refining your own voice and style. By the end of the semester you\u2019ll have filled a portfolio with dozens of sentences that you can draw from for the final project, an original story or essay that will contain at least one sentence of every type.\n\u00a0This section is offered through Distance and Online Education.
